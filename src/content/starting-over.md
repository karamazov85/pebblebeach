I’m not used to being  
given things for free  
Presents and luck tend  
to ring alarms in me.

And so I keep upending  
Hitting delete and reset  
on anything that’s getting  
too easy, cosy and set.

Maybe because all summits  
become plateaus over time,  
And arriving feels like giving up  
Or running out of line.
