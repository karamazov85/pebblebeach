Without overthinking  
let’s just understand

the overeducated underachievers  
who overpopulate the understory

the underestimated overconfident  
who have overrun all under the sky

the understatedly subtle, undercut  
by the overwhelming and its hype

the overused filters that overexpose  
what underwhelms otherwise

the bleak undercurrents that undermine  
the overpowering, bullish overtones.

Without overreacting  
let’s just underscore:

under-liked, I keep watching  
over lives that we call lives

and refuse to go under  
till all this over/under

is over.
